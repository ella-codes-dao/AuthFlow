# AuthFlow
{: .fs-9 }

AuthFlow is an Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) system secured by the Flow Blockchain.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Current blockchain-based authentication methods typically only allow a developer to confirm who a user is and has to utilize other Web2 authentication methods and services to do anything beyond smart contract interactions. As we move into a Web3 world there are still many use cases that require secure access to Web2 technologies and even things as simple as just role-based access control to an app's functions.

AuthFlow is an on-chain Identity & Access Management system and a replacement for something like AWS IAM or Azure Active Directory. Utilizing the Flow Blockchain we can return control of user identification and authentication to the app developer and end-users. Each app will create its own AuthSystem that can be managed by multiple AuthSystemAdmins. To ensure the integrity of the Authentication System, once the contract is deployed all keys will be removed from the account preventing any future modification of the contracts that change the way the system authenticates users.
